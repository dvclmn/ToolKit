// MARK: - Usage Examples

/// Example 1: Basic integer stepping
/// ```
/// var counter = 5
/// counter = counter.stepping(by: 2, in: 0...10)
/// print("Counter after stepping up: \(counter)") // 7
///
/// counter = counter.steppingDown(by: 3, in: 0...10)
/// print("Counter after stepping down: \(counter)") // 4
/// ```
///
/// Example 2: Double with callback
/// ```
/// var temperature = 20.5
/// temperature = temperature.stepping(by: 0.5, in: -10.0...30.0) { old, new in
///   print("Temperature changed from \(old)° to \(new)°")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Example 3: Checking if step is possible
/// ```
/// let value = 95
/// let canIncrement = value.canStep(by: 10, in: 0...100) // true
/// let canIncrementMore = value.canStep(by: 20, in: 0...100) // false (would be 115)
/// ```
///
/// Example 4: CGFloat stepping (useful for UI values)
/// ```
/// import CoreGraphics
///
/// var opacity: CGFloat = 0.5
/// opacity = opacity.steppingUp(by: 0.1, in: 0.0...1.0)
/// print("Opacity: \(opacity)") // 0.6
/// ```
///
/// Example 5: Using in a loop with clamping
/// ```
/// var progress = 0
/// for _ in 1...15 {
///   progress = progress.stepping(by: 10, in: 0...100)
///   print("Progress: \(progress)")
/// }
/// // Will stop at 100 and stay there
/// ```
///
/// Example 6: Custom stepping logic with callback
/// ```
/// struct Volume {
///   var level: Double = 50.0
///
///   mutating func increase() {
///     level = level.stepping(by: 5, in: 0...100) { old, new in
///       print("Volume: \(old) → \(new)")
///     }
///   }
///
///   mutating func decrease() {
///     level = level.steppingDown(by: 5, in: 0...100)
///   }
/// }
///
/// var vol = Volume()
/// vol.increase() // Volume: 50.0 → 55.0
/// vol.decrease() // Back to 50.0
/// ```
