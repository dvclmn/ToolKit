/// Describes how a type's stored components map to logical axes.
///
/// Many types store two scalars in a fixed order (e.g. `CGSize` stores `(width, height)`,
/// `CGPoint` stores `(x, y)`). In most contexts, width/x correspond to the horizontal axis
/// and height/y to the vertical axis. In rotated or transposed contexts, this assumption
/// can be inverted. `AxisMapping` makes that relationship explicit.
///
/// - `.identity`: primary storage corresponds to horizontal; secondary to vertical.
/// - `.transposed`: primary storage corresponds to vertical; secondary to horizontal.
///
/// Thread an explicit `AxisMapping` into read/write helpers to keep axis-oriented code
/// correct even when coordinate systems are flipped.
public enum AxisMapping: Sendable {

  /// # Primary is Horizontal
  /// Normal: Width/Column is Horizontal, Height/Row is Vertical.
  /// Previously: `primaryIsHorizontal` / `widthIsHorizontal`
  case identity

  /// # Primary is Vertical
  /// Flipped: Width/Column is Vertical, Height/Row is Horizontal.
  /// Previously: `primaryIsVertical` / `heightIsHorizontal`
  case transposed

  /// Note: A third possible Axis could be 3D (Z-axis), this pattern could
  /// work by just adding a .depth case to the enums.

  /// The default mapping for typical Cartesian layouts (horizontal ↔ primary, vertical ↔ secondary).

  /// With `.transposed`, this selection is flipped.
