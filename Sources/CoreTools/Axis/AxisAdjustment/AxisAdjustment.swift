/// A convenience protocol for types that expose two scalar components addressable by axis.
///
/// Conforming types (for example `CGPoint` (x/y), `CGSize` (width/height), `UnitPoint`,
/// and `CGVector`) gain ergonomic helpers for reading and writing values along a
/// `GeometryAxis` while honoring an `AxisMapping` (identity vs. transposed).
///
/// Use these APIs when the usual assumptions (x → horizontal, y → vertical) don't always
/// hold. By threading an explicit `AxisMapping`, you can write axis-oriented code that
/// remains correct under rotated/transposed coordinate systems.
